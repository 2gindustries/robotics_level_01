# robotics_level_01
Basic ML robotics project with Raspberry Pi 4

## Main goal
Learn how to integrate both a ML project (super simple Linear Regression) with a Raspberry Pi 4

### Materials:
- Raspberry pi 4
- Ultrasound
- Led
- Cables

### Steps:
1. Create model trained to predict next step of object towards ultrasound
2. If distance is less than x, light the led
